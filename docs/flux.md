### 4. Background Swapping
Changing environments while preserving subject integrity:
- **Outdoor Scenes**: Parks, beaches, mountains, cityscapes
- **Indoor Settings**: Offices, homes, studios, restaurants
- **Fantasy Environments**: Magical forests, space scenes, abstract backgrounds
- **Weather Changes**: Sunny to rainy, day to night
- **Seasonal Changes**: Summer to winter transformations
- **Architectural**: Different building styles and periods

### 5. Character Consistency
Maintaining identity across multiple edits and variations:
- **Facial Features**: Preserving identity while allowing style changes
- **Body Proportions**: Consistent character dimensions
- **Clothing Consistency**: Matching outfits across poses
- **Age Progression**: Showing the same person at different ages
- **Expression Variations**: Different emotions while maintaining identity
- **Pose Variations**: Same character in different positions
