How Could We Implement This?
1. Define a Tool Abstraction
Each tool is a wrapper around an external API or function (e.g., “search_web”, “generate_image”, “swap_face”).

Tools have a name, description, input schema, and output schema.

Example:

python
class Tool:
    def __init__(self, name, description, input_schema, output_schema, func):
        ...
    def invoke(self, input):
        ...
2. Register Tools with Agents
Each agent is given access to a set of relevant tools.

Agents can reason about which tool to use based on the current task and context.

3. Dynamic Tool Invocation
During planning and execution, the agent (or a central planner) decides which tool(s) to call.

The agent constructs the input, invokes the tool, and processes the output.

Results are passed downstream or used for further reasoning.

4. Tool Chaining and Orchestration
Agents can chain tool calls: e.g., retrieve a reference image (tool 1), then generate an image (tool 2), then edit it (tool 3).

The orchestration layer manages dependencies and data flow between tools.

5. Example Workflow in Pic Arcade
User Prompt: “Put me in the dress Taylor Swift wore at the awards.”

Planning Agent: Breaks down the task and selects tools: search_web, extract_outfit, generate_image, face_swap.

Agents: Sequentially invoke tools, passing results along the chain.

Supervisor: Monitors execution, handles errors, and returns the final result.

Summary Table: Tool Use in Agentic Systems
System	Tool Use Purpose	Example Tools	Workflow Integration
Claude	External API calls, data actions	Web search, code exec	Function calling, tool chaining
Cursor	Code manipulation, debugging	Add logs, run tests	User/AI-initiated tool calls
Perplexity	Web search, knowledge retrieval	Search, summarization	Automatic invocation
Pic Arcade	Image/video API, retrieval, edit	Search, gen, edit, swap	Agent-tool modular interface
Conclusion
Explicitly modeling “tools” as first-class citizens in Pic Arcade’s architecture—just as leading AI systems do—will make your agent workflows more modular, extensible, and powerful. Each agent should be able to dynamically select and invoke tools (APIs/functions) as needed, chaining them together to fulfill complex user requests. This approach is not only considered in our plan—it’s foundational for building scalable, intelligent, agentic systems
