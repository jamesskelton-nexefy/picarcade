## üö® Important Notes

### Cost Management
- Tests make **real API calls** and incur actual costs
- Estimated total cost for full test suite: **$2-5**
- Rate limiting is built-in to avoid overwhelming APIs
- Failed tests don't incur generation costs

### Test Images
- All test images are high-quality photos from Unsplash
- Images are publicly accessible and license-free
- URLs include optimization parameters for consistent testing
- No sensitive or copyrighted content is used

### Rate Limiting
- Built-in delays between API calls (2-5 seconds)
- Respects API rate limits and fair usage
- Longer delays for complex operations
- Automatic retry logic for transient failures

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Missing API Keys
```bash
‚ùå Missing REPLICATE_API_TOKEN: Not configured (REQUIRED)
```
**Solution**: Run `npm run setup:test-env` to configure keys

#### 2. Invalid API Key Format
```bash
‚ö†Ô∏è Invalid format OPENAI_API_KEY: sk-abc... (should be 40+ chars)
```
**Solution**: Check your API key format and regenerate if needed

#### 3. Network/API Errors
```bash
ReplicateError: Model not found or unavailable
```
**Solution**: Check API status and retry. Some models may be temporarily unavailable.

#### 4. Rate Limiting
```bash
HTTP 429: Too Many Requests
```
**Solution**: Tests include automatic backoff. Wait and retry.

### Debug Mode

Run tests with verbose output:

```bash
# Detailed test output
npm run test:flux -- -v -s

# Show API calls and timing
npm run test:quick -- -v -s --tb=short
```

npm run show:test-commands

# Monitor test progress
npm run test:performance -- -v
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### Before Running Tests
1. **Verify API keys** are properly configured
2. **Check account balances** to ensure sufficient credits
3. **Run quick test first** to validate setup
4. **Monitor costs** during test execution

### During Testing
1. **Don't interrupt** tests mid-execution (may leave partial charges)
2. **Monitor output** for errors or unexpected behavior
3. **Note performance metrics** for optimization
4. **Check rate limiting** if tests slow down

### After Testing
1. **Review test results** and success rates
2. **Check API usage** in provider dashboards
3. **Report issues** with specific test names and errors
4. **Clean up** any temporary files or resources

## üîÑ Continuous Integration

For CI/CD environments, use environment-based configuration:

```bash
# Validate environment in CI
npm run validate:test-env

# Run subset for CI (faster, cheaper)
npm run test:quick

# Full test suite for releases
npm run test:real-world
```
